# AT2-Part3
String Manipulation and Files.

Programming Requirement

In this part, you are required to design and implement a range of algorithms to manipulate strings. The following operations need to be done using JavaScript programming language and the result need to be verified using node.

You will then need to create an algorithm and implement this to write a string to a text file and read in a text file. Reading and writing to file can be done in either C# or JavaScript. If using JavaScript, you will need to verify the results using Node.js.

As per the pervious parts, there are spaces for you to record your version control. The repository, branch name and commit code.
You should start a new repository for this part.

1.	Define the following strings: 
•	myString = “This is a string”
•	anotherString = “   Another string” (note there are 3 blank spaces at the beginning)
•	hello = “Hello there!
•	myName = your first name
2.	Use the utility functions length and chat to find out information
•	Find out the length of myString
•	Find out the first character of myString
•	Find out the 11th character of myString
3.	Use the slice and substring functions to create new strings.
•	Slice “is a” from myString
•	Use substring to get “the” from anotherString
4.	Change the case of the myName string
•	Print out the myName string in all upper case
•	Print out the myName string in all lower case

5.	Use concat, trim, replace and split to create new strings 
•	Concat hello and myName together
•	Use the trim function to remove the spaces in anotherString
•	Use the replace function to change “is a” to an empty space in myString
•	Split myString on the spaces.
6.	Create algorithms 
•	Create algorithm for saving string to a text file
•	Create algorithm for reading in the text file

7.	Write a text file
•	Name the text file output.txt
•	Create a string of data to save to a text file
•	Write the string to the text file
8.	Read text from a text file
•	Get the file name output.txt
•	Read in the text file
•	Prin the text that was read in, to the screen.
Submit for review
You are required to submit the following for review
1.	This assessment document with all questions answered
2.	All source code files
You are required to compress all files should in a zip file and submit the zip file for review.
